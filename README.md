# NeuroSim - A Neural Network Brain Activity Simulator
# By Sawyer888 ok :thumbs_up:

## Features
- **Simulates firing neurons** and **synaptic transmission**.
- **Implements Hebbian Learning** ("fire together, wire together").
- **Multithreaded neural updates for efficiency**.
- **Scalable network size (1,000+ neurons possible).**

## Required Dependencies

- Before running NeuroSim, you need to install:

- Make (for compilation automation)
- OpenGL (for neural network visualization)
- GLEW (for OpenGL extensions)
- GLFW (for window management)
- g++ (GCC) (C++ compiler)

## Installation & Compilation
1. **Clone the repository**
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/sawyer-888/NeuroSim.git
   cd NeuroSim
2. Compile project using: make
3. Run the simulation using: ./NeuroSim
4. To remove compiled files (.o object files and the executable), run: make clean
